# DecryptorXECryption
A small shell script for decrypting XECryption 
Any help that would make this a better script or more streamlined would be most appriciated.

As for the use of the program a <cat [filename] | ./Formater |./DecryptorXECryption works 
The formater script is a simple sed and fmt meant to arrange the numbers 

The encrypted.txt is meant as a test use file.

Any questions or concerns please email me at Binaryice27@gmail.com 

Thank you
